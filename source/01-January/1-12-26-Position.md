# Postion Template Subsystem Test
    James
    Group: Aadi, Anay, Avika, James, Mason

# Goals
- Test the template subsystem

# Notes
- Motion Magic is a position controller. It reads a position value from the motor or source and using that to get a voltage and velocity number. It is not a regular PID controller; It is called a PID Motion Profile. Plans out exactly how it wants the position/velocity to go for the wheel. 
- When testing Abruticus, the reason the pivot wouldn't move out of its starting position was because the cruise velocity was zero, meaning there no velocity for the pivot to move.
- Motion Magic takes all the info from the motor; if there is a remote source, motion magic will use that remote source correctly.

# Results
- Couldn't test
- First computer couldn't connect to robot
- Second computer connected to robot, but didn't work after that
- SD card on robot was stuck/broken
- Fix during 1/14/26 meeting
