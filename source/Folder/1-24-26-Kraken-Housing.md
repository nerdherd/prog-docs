How to house craken
-
 
1. Pick a wire red or black
2. Take out a Power Pole and line it up against the wire. With the tab side down on the wire and the hooked tab at the end facing out of the wire, make the inner edge of the large tab on the end of the wire and mark the place the end of the Power Pole ends with something (Fingernail indent, marker, idk)
3. Using a wire stripper, line the wire up so the number 10 is on top and the mark from step 2 is aligned with the blade area. Cut.
4. Twist the bare wires to keep them organised.
5. Place the Power Pole in the Crimper on slot 45 with the long tab inside so that the all tabs are facing up.
6. Place the wire into the crimper and as you crimp push the wire deeper into the crimper so no bare wires are exposed
7. Get a housing of the correct color. Look into the connector end and make sure the metal side is on the bottom. 
8. Get the wire and make sure the Power Pole's hook is facing down
9. Push the wire into the housing until a click can be heard
10. Pull on the wire and housing to make sure it is securely inside
11. Repeat for the other wire
12. TBA (After Wheeler and I added the housing assembly team took over to house the CAN wires)

After we housed all the Krakens Wheeler and I separated more Power Pole connectors from their stamping strips.
