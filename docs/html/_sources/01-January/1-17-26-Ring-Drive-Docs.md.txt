# Ring Drive Documentation
    James and Rohan
    Group: James, Rohan, William

# Goals 
- Test and debug Mason's ring drive code

# Notes
- Robot is supposed to move to position of joystick in the set circle
- Lowered speed of ring drive
- Contructor takes swereve drive and 2 inputs - the x and y input of the joystick
- X speed is modified by x input 
- Y speed followed however much you tilt the controller
- The code is super complicated and we are backtracking
- Testing Drive to targets
- Robot correctly moves to origin
- Drive to target is working but a little jittery
