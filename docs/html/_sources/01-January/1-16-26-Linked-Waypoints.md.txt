How to make a linked waypoint  
-

1. Place the start point at the position you wish to make a linked waypoint at  
2. On the right side open Waypoints > Start Point > Link Waypoint (The link symbol)  
3. Name the waypoint and press confirm  
4. Before making a new waypoint press the Link Waypoint button again to unlink the position (This does NOT delete the link waypoint only make the start point unlinked.)  
5. Repeat from step 1 until all waypoints are made.


How to connect an event marker to a command
-
1. In PathPlanner create an event marker in path planner
2. In vscode register the PathPlanner commands, after all subsystem related commands have been defined, using the named command class in path planner library.


Continuation
