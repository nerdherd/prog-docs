# Goals:
- configure the new radio because the access point wasn't appearing

# Results:
- the radio was able be configured due to the network assistant tool. The error was the radio never had its own ip address. We were able to connect to the radio via ethernet because of the software we used.
- Tested drive and rotation of wheels
- Successfully calibrated swerve drive

# Notes:
- Use the limelight for Apriltags
- Problem: we updated motors to 2026, but we couldn't do characterization so we updated phoenix tuner to 2026 but it was the wrong version of 2026 so we had to go back to the 2025 version for everything
- Using Hotspot to download vendor libraries (lead note: school wifi blocks downloads during initial builds, subsequent builds don't require redownloads, though)
