# 2-9-26 Alliance Heading Reset
    Anay Saran, William Hoang

## Goals
- To make robot and driver heading reset properly on both alliances.
- Make sure autos work on both alliances

## Notes
- In NerdDrivetrain.java, there is a function called setDriverHeadingForward()
- This takes into account the alliance color and the swerve heading to ensure robot oriented driving is always forward based on the driver station
