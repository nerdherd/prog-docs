## Procedure for Measuring Limelights
1. Open Limelight Dashboard using IP address.
2. Measure the width of the robot in meters.
3. Divide the width by 2.
4. Measure the distance from the left edge of the robot to the center of the Limelight lens.
5. Subtract the Limelight distance from the divided width.
6. If the Limelight is on the left side of the robot, set that as the negative Right value.
7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 for Forward and Up values, using the depth and height respectively.
