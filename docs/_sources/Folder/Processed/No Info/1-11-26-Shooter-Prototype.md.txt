# Shooter Prototype Testing
    Ayush

- I wired the power for testbench for testing the shooter prototype
- I made the CAN loop for the shooter prototype testbench
- While testing I ramped up the voltage to certain test points to test how the prototype would do at different distances, voltages, or velocities.
- Then I created a plot on Pheonix Tuner X to track the MotorVoltage and Velocity while testing
- Then after ASM replaced the bottom roller we retested the prototype (1B)
- I created a then exported all of these plots in table format into csv files
- Then I analyzed all the files and looked at the drop in velocity after firing a game piece, and then after rapid fire in Desmos
- Lastly, I published all of the files into Microsoft Teams

*please do not forget to reset the voltage before enabling the test bench*
